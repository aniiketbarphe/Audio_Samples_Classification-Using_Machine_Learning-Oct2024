# Audio_Samples_Classification-Using_Machine_Learning-Oct2024

Welcome to Week 13 of the Weekly MachineHack Hackathon Series!

This week’s challenge is focused on developing a model that can distinguish between major and minor chords using audio data. Music is a language of patterns, and in this challenge, you’ll tap into the structure and rules of music theory to build a classifier for different chord types.

About the Dataset
The dataset contains audio files from two instruments: guitar and piano. In music, major chords are often associated with feelings of happiness and brightness, while minor chords evoke sadness or melancholy. Your task is to classify whether a tune is based on a major or minor chord using modern algorithms and machine learning techniques.

Dataset Description:
Train.csv: Mapping for training audio files and their classification.
Test.csv: The dataset for which you will generate predictions.
Submission.csv: The format for submitting your predictions.
Participation and Benefits:
Skill Level: This challenge is designed for participants with experience in audio classification, signal processing, and machine learning.
Community Engagement: Join our Telegram group to connect with other participants, ask questions, and share insights.
Recognition: All participants will receive a MachineHack certificate, and top performers will be highlighted on the leaderboard.
Live Walkthrough: A live session will be held on 16th Oct 2024 to guide you through the challenge and provide expert tips.
Submission and Evaluation:
Submission Format: Submit your predictions in the provided Submission.csv file.
Evaluation Metric: Submissions will be evaluated based on the Accuracy Score.
Leaderboard: Track your performance and strive to reach the top!
How to Approach the Challenge:
Data Preprocessing: Extract key audio features (such as MFCCs, chroma, or spectrogram) to represent the audio signals effectively.
Feature Engineering: Focus on relevant signal processing techniques to handle the differences between major and minor chords.
Modeling Techniques: Experiment with models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and deep learning architectures like CNNs or RNNs for audio classification.
Validation and Tuning: Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
A starter notebook will be available to guide you through the initial data preprocessing steps and basic model building.
